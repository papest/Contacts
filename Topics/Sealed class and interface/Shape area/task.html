  <p>You have a sealed class called <code class="java">Shape</code>. Declare a function called <code class="java">calculateArea()</code>, which takes the sealed class as a parameter and returns the <strong>area</strong> as a <code class="java">Double</code>.</p> 
  <p>You can use the following formulas:</p> 
  <p>Square <span class="math-tex">\(A = {a^2}\)</span> where a is the side.</p> 
  <p>Rectangle <span class="math-tex">\(A = {w l}\)</span> where w is the width and l is the length.</p> 
  <p>Circle <span class="math-tex">\(A = {πr^2}\)</span> where r is the radius.</p> 
  <p>Triangle <span class="math-tex">\(A = {hb_b/2}\)</span> where b is the base and <span class="math-tex">\(h_b\)</span> is the height.</p> 
  <p>Pentagon <span class="math-tex">\(A = {\frac{1}{4}{\sqrt{5(5+2\sqrt5)} }} \times a^2\)</span> where a is the side.</p>
