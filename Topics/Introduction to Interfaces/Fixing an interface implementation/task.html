<h2>Fixing an interface implementation</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>

  <p></p> 
  <p>Following the topic of 2D simulations, imagine we have an interface of a simulated physical object, as well as an implementation of this interface in an instance of this object – in our case, a Stone.</p> 
  <pre><code class="language-kotlin">data class Vector2(var x: Int, var y: Int)

interface PhysicalBody2D {
    val affectedByGravity: Boolean
        get() = true
    val simulated: Boolean
        get() = true

    val mass : Double
    val gravityStrength : Double

    val velocity : Vector2

    // You don't need to implement these functions
    fun simulate()
    fun stopSimulation()
    fun setVelocityToZero()
}</code></pre> 
  <p>However, the interface was not implemented properly. Correct the implementation, considering that the Stone</p> 
  <p>1) Is supposed to have the mass of 0.25;</p> 
  <p>2) Is supposed to have zero velocity;</p> 
  <p>3) Is also supposed to be normally affected by gravity.</p>
