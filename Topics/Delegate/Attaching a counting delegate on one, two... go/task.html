  <p></p> 
  <p>You are given an interface and its implementation, so your task is to complete the <code class="java">Iterator</code> class using the said implementation as a delegate to count the number of calls made to the function <code class="java">next()</code>, which you need to implement. For the sake of simplicity, assume that the function <code class="java">next()</code> does not do anything apart from calling a delegate.</p> 
  <p>In other words, make a function <code class="java">next()</code> that counts its calls via the <code class="java">Counter</code> class present as a delegate.</p>
